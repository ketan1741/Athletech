/* Modern Device Wind Sensor Sketch for Rev C Wind Sensor
 This sketch is only valid if the wind sensor if powered from 
 a regulated 5 volt supply. An Arduino or Modern Device BBB, RBBB
 powered from an external power supply should work fine. Powering from
 USB will also work but will be slightly less accurate in our experience.
 
When using an Arduino to power the sensor, an external power supply is better. Most Arduinos have a 
 polyfuse which protects the USB line. This fuse has enough resistance to reduce the voltage
 available to around 4.7 to 4.85 volts, depending on the current draw. 
 
 The sketch uses the on-chip temperature sensing thermistor to compensate the sensor
 for changes in ambient temperature. Because the thermistor is just configured as a
 voltage divider, the voltage will change with supply voltage. This is why the 
 sketch depends upon a regulated five volt supply.
 
 Other calibrations could be developed for different sensor supply voltages, but would require
 gathering data for those alternate voltages, or compensating the ratio.
